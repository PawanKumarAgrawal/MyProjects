P&G’s Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy
Effective March 1, 2024
The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”, “P&G Co”, “We”) is committed to respecting your privacy. Our [Global Privacy Policy](https://privacypolicy.pg.com/CHD-en/<https:/privacypolicy.pg.com/en-US/>) describes how we handle your personal data generally. This supplemental Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy (“Health Privacy Policy”) explains our practices for “Consumer Health Data” as such term is defined by applicable laws including Washington’s My Health My Data Act, Nevada’s Consumer Health Data Privacy Law, Connecticut’s Data Privacy Act, and other U.S. health privacy laws, as each are amended and as and when they become effective including any regulations thereunder (“U.S. Health Privacy Laws”).
“Consumer Health Data” is broadly defined to mean personal information that is linked or can be reasonably linked to a consumer and that that identifies past, present or future physical or mental health status. Consumer Health Data includes information about medical conditions as well as non-medical information, such as biometric data, information about use of non-prescription medication or use of health-related products, for example. Consumer Health Data does not include information pertaining to individuals with whom we have an employment relationship.
If we make any material updates to this Health Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by U.S. Health Privacy Laws, including by either notifying you at the time of collecting Consumer Health Data, or by updating this Health Privacy Policy earlier than required. We reserve the right to amend this Health Privacy Policy at our discretion and at any time.
